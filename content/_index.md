# UI Navigation
UI Navigation, or known as zluinav, is a Zola theme designed for accessibility rather than visual and made as easy as possible using templates and macros. Since I am a blind developer, I'd like to develop with accessibility as possible so visually impaired users can use them.

Zola is a fast site generator written in Rust powered by tera as its templating engine and contained a powerful theme creation feature.

All possible code formats and shortcodes are provided as an example in English at [Example page](@/example.md "Example code formats and shortcodes in English!")
