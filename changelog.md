# UI Navigation theme changelog
## New on Saturday, September 21, 2024
* You can now disable the navigation. To do so, do not set `nav` table in `extra`. The navigation skip link will also be automatically disabled. As such, "no navigation found" error will not be shown.
* Fixed blank lines in templates. To rebase the templates, it is recommended to use whitespace control, the dash (`-`) for the blocks and extends but it is not required.
* Post title and post description will now show sepretly.
